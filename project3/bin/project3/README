Project Description
For this project, we had to implement a program that takes a series of lines, followed by pairs of points, and check whether those points are intersected by any of the lines. In order to do this, we store the lines in a binary tree. The method to insert a new line into the tree is somewhat complicated. Essentially, we check to see if the line to be inserted intersects with the line at the root node. If it does, then the new line is inserted on both sides of the tree, calling the insert method recursively. If the line does not intersect with the node within the box, then it is only inserted on one side of the tree: the left side if the line is counterclockwise and right if the line is clockwise. However there is another parameter that has to be considered when inserting lines as well: the number of lines it has intersected. If the line intersects a parent node but not the child node, it should not be inserted below the child node, only on the empty side of the parent node. In order to check if a pair of points are in the same region, we search the tree for a line that intersects them. The search method is called on the root, which will then search one side of the tree based on the location of the points in relation to the line. If a line is found that intersects the points, that line is returned. If no such line is found, the method returns null. There are also methods that get the external path length, external nodes (which represents the number of regions in the box), and the average path length.

File Contents
TreeNode.java contains the class for a node in the class BinaryTree.java. PointLocation.java contains the main method, which gets input from the user and creates the tree. Line.java and Point.java store the data for points and lines that are used in this project. OUTPUT1.txt, OUTPUT6.txt, and OUTPUT10.txt contain the output of the program from the corresponding input files. The files input1.txt through input11.txt contain the test cases that I used to test this project.
